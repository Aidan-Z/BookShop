                <h3>The Founder</h3>

                <p>
                    Our company was first founded Johnson Johnson who in 1879 said <q>people need to read more books!</q> 
                    this observation was made while he was reading his morning paper, where he noticed the following passage which we have quoted for your convenience:
                </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>People are not reading enough books, and this is a problem! It is a problem becasue if people do not read, then reading is not carried out to the degree that we would like to see readers reading.</p>
                    </blockquote> 
                <p>
                    This changed his whole world view, and since then he has had the idea to open bookshop. unfortunetly his goal was never met, but we've tried to carry on his legacy!
                </p>
